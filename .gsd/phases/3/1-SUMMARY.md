# Phase 3 Plan 1 — Summary

## What Was Done
- Updated `Footer.astro` with real social links:
  - LinkedIn → https://www.linkedin.com/in/elias-vanier-deafllc
  - GitHub → https://github.com/eevanier
  - Email → mailto:eev7147@rit.edu
- Added Resume link (`/Elias_Vanier_Resume.pdf`) to both desktop and mobile nav in `Navbar.astro`
- Created `public/favicon.svg` — industrial minimalist EV monogram (dark zinc background, white bold text)
- `Layout.astro` already had correct favicon.svg reference and OpenGraph metadata — no changes needed

## Verification
- `npm run build` — exit code 0 ✅
- Source-level QA confirmed all links, content, and file references are correct ✅
