# Plan 2.2 Summary

## What Was Done
- Visual verification of all 3 projects on `/projects` index and detail pages
- Confirmed:
  - All 3 project cards display with thumbnails, titles, taglines, and tags
  - Detail pages render title, tagline, meta row (tags, role, timeline)
  - Overview tab shows Challenge/Approach/Results cards
  - Build Log tab shows timeline entries with stages, dates, and descriptions
  - Projects sorted by date (newest first)
  - No broken images or layout issues

## Deviations
- Only 3 projects verified instead of planned 5 (user decision)
- Plan 2.2 Task 1 (create remaining 2 projects) skipped — user deferred
