## Phase 2 Verification

### Must-Haves
- [x] Sample project (`src/content/projects/sample/`) deleted — VERIFIED (directory no longer exists)
- [x] 3 project directories created under `src/content/projects/` — VERIFIED (universal-kydex-enclosure, oil-based-skateboard-paint-pens, high-performance-electric-skateboards)
- [x] Each project has `index.md` with valid frontmatter matching config.ts schema — VERIFIED (astro build passes)
- [x] Each project has a thumbnail image — VERIFIED (sharp-generated placeholder PNGs)
- [x] `npx astro build` completes without errors — VERIFIED
- [x] Projects appear on /projects index page — VERIFIED (browser screenshot)
- [x] Detail pages render Overview tab (Challenge/Approach/Results) — VERIFIED (browser screenshot)
- [x] Detail pages render Build Log tab with timeline — VERIFIED (browser screenshot)

### Deviations from Original Plan
- 3 projects instead of 5 (user decision to defer remaining 2)
- Placeholder thumbnails instead of real/AI-generated images (image generation service unavailable)

### Verdict: PASS
