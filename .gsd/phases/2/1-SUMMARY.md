# Plan 2.1 Summary

## What Was Done
- Collected project details for 3 portfolio projects (user deferred projects 4 & 5)
- Deleted sample project (`src/content/projects/sample/`)
- Created 3 project content folders with complete frontmatter and body content:
  - `universal-kydex-enclosure/` — Kydex enclosure for DIY electric skateboards
  - `oil-based-skateboard-paint-pens/` — Custom paint pens for skateboard customization
  - `high-performance-electric-skateboards/` — Two purpose-built electric skateboards
- Generated placeholder PNG thumbnails using sharp (image gen service unavailable)
- `npx astro build` passes with no errors

## Deviations
- Only 3 projects instead of planned 5 (user decision — will add more later)
- Used programmatic placeholder thumbnails instead of AI-generated images (service 503)
