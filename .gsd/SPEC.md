# SPEC.md — Project Specification

> **Status**: `FINALIZED`

## Vision
A precision-engineered digital portfolio that reflects the discipline of mechanical engineering. The site will feature a "Minimalist Industrial" aesthetic—clean lines, monochromatic palette with subtle technical accents, and smooth, purposeful interactions—allowing the engineering work to take center stage.

## Goals
1.  **Professional Showcase**: Present mechanical engineering projects with high-fidelity images, videos, and technical descriptions to impress recruiters.
2.  **Effortless Management**: Enable "Code-light" updates where adding a project is as simple as creating a folder and a Markdown file.
3.  **Modern Experience**: distinct from standard templates; utilizing subtle animations and a responsive design to feel "fresh" and "unique".

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
-   **Complex Backend**: No database or server-side logic (e.g., user accounts).
-   **E-commerce**: No selling of products or services.
-   **CMS Interface**: No graphical admin panel (unless requested later); file-system based management is preferred.

## Users
-   **Primary**: Recruiters and Hiring Managers (Scanning for skills, project diversity, and presentation quality).
-   **Secondary**: Peers and Collaborators (Detailed technical review).
-   **Tertiary**: The User (Elias) (Easy maintenance and pride of ownership).

## Constraints
-   **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (Static site).
-   **Content**: Must handle images and video embeds effectively.
-   **Timeline**: ASAP (Student portfolio cycle).

## Success Criteria
-   [ ] Site deploys successfully to GitHub Pages.
-   [ ] "Project" content type is established (Title, Date, Description, Gallery, Tech Stack).
-   [ ] Adding a new project requires no code changes, just content files.
-   [ ] Mobile-responsive and accessible (Lighthouse score > 90).
