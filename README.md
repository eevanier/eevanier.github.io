## 📝 How to Add a New Project

Adding a new project is as simple as creating a folder and a markdown file.

1.  **Create a Project Folder**:
    Navigate to `src/content/projects/` and create a new folder for your project (e.g., `my-new-project`).

2.  **Add `index.md`**:
    Inside your new folder, create an `index.md` file with the following frontmatter:

    ```markdown
    ---
    title: "My New Project"
    description: "A brief description of what this project is about."
    date: 2023-10-27
    tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2"]
    heroImage: "./hero.jpg"
    featured: true # Optional: Set to true to display on the home page
    ---

    Your project content goes here...
    ```

3.  **Add Images**:
    Place your `hero.jpg` and any other images directly in the project folder. You can reference them in your markdown like this: `![Alt text](./image.jpg)`.

---
title: "My New Project"
tagline: "A cool project I built."
date: 2024-03-20
tags: ["Design", "Dev"]
# Reference the thumbnail in the same folder
thumbnail: "./thumbnail.png"

# Optional: Add a gallery of images
gallery:
  - "./gallery-1.jpg"
  - "./gallery-2.jpg"

buildLog:
  - stage: "Prototyping"
    description: "Initial sketches."
    # Optional: Add images to a specific build stage
    images:
      - "./sketch.png"
---

## Project Description

You can also use standard Markdown to include images in the body:

![Description of image](./another-view.jpg)
