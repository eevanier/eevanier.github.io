buildLog:
  - stage: "Concept & Research"
    date: "Week 1"
    description: "Conducted literature review on locking mechanisms. Benchmarked 5 competing designs. Selected cam-lock variant for further development."
  - stage: "CAD & Simulation"
    date: "Week 2-4"
    description: "Created parametric CAD model in SolidWorks. Ran FEA stress analysis — identified stress concentration at pivot. Added 2mm fillet, reducing peak stress by 35%."
  - stage: "Prototyping"
    date: "Week 5-7"
    description: "Fabricated first prototype using CNC aluminum and 3D-printed ABS fixtures. Validated fit and assembly sequence."
  - stage: "Testing & Iteration"
    date: "Week 8-10"
    description: "Completed 500-cycle endurance test. Measured 0.02mm max deflection — well within 0.1mm tolerance. Iterated on surface finish for improved grip."

# Project Alpha

This is a sample project to demonstrate the content collection schema.

## Features

- **Blazing Fast**: Built with Astro.
- **Minimalist Design**: Following the industrial aesthetic.
- **Type-safe Content**: Leveraging Content Collections.

## Challenges

Implementing the design system required careful consideration of spacing and typography.
