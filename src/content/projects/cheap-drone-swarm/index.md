## Overview

The Cheap Drone Swarm project aimed to democratize access to swarm robotics research by lowering the barrier to entry. By utilizing readily available, low-cost components, we were able to create a platform that is accessible to hobbyists and researchers alike.

## Key Features

- **Low Cost per Unit**: optimized for affordability without sacrificing essential flight characteristics.
- **Scalable Architecture**: The system is designed to easily add more drones to the swarm.
- **Open Source Hardware**: All frame designs and component lists are open for community modification.

## Future Work

Future iterations will focus on integrating more advanced sensors for obstacle avoidance and implementing more complex swarm behaviors such as cooperative mapping and search and rescue patterns.
