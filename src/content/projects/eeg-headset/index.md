## Overview

This project explores the intersection of hardware design and neuroscience. The EEG Headset is a custom-built device designed to lower the barrier to entry for brain-computer interface (BCI) research and applications.

## Technical Details

- **Electrode System**: Uses dry spring-loaded electrodes for quick setup without conductive gel.
- **Ergonomics**: The frame is designed to distribute pressure evenly, allowing for comfortable use during extended sessions.
- **Signal Quality**: Shielded cabling and active shielding on the board minimize power line interference.

## Applications

The headset is currently used for controlling simple game interfaces and monitoring concentration levels during study sessions.
