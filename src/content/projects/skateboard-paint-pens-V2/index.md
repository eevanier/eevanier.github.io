challenge: "Skaters lacked a dedicated, high-quality tool for customizing their boards. Standard paint pens quickly lost their vibrancy, faded, and deteriorated when applied to rough griptape and exposed to dirt and wear."
solution: "Formulated and rigorously tested custom oil-based paint solutions engineered for high adhesion, heavy-duty durability, and sustained color vibrancy specifically on skateboard surfaces."
outcome: "Successfully launched the brand, sold over 3,000 units, and achieved a 4.5-star rating on Amazon — validating both the product-market fit and the formulation."

## Overview

The Oil-Based Skateboard Paint Pens project addressed a clear gap in the skate accessories market. Existing paint pens weren't formulated for the unique demands of skateboard surfaces — rough griptape eats through standard ink, and constant exposure to dirt and moisture left designs looking faded within days.

## Product Development

- **Custom Formulation**: The oil-based paint was specifically engineered for adhesion to coarse griptape surfaces, providing lasting vibrancy that standard water-based or acrylic markers couldn't achieve.
- **Applicator Design**: The pen tips were selected to work with — not against — the rough texture of griptape, enabling clean lines and consistent paint flow.
- **Durability Testing**: Each batch was stress-tested against real-world skating conditions, including abrasion, moisture exposure, and UV fading.

## Market Performance

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Units Sold | 3,000+ |
| Amazon Rating | 4.5 ★ |
| Price Point | Competitive with art-grade markers |
| Distribution | Amazon (FBA) |

## Key Takeaways

This venture taught me the full lifecycle of a consumer product — from R&D and formulation through branding, Amazon listing optimization, inventory management, and scaling. The 4.5-star rating validated that the core thesis was right: skaters wanted a purpose-built tool, not a repurposed art supply.
