challenge: "Capturing fast-moving subjects like cars or other drones requires a platform that is extremely fast, agile, and stable. Off-the-shelf drones often lack the necessary top speed or maneuverability."
solution: "Built a custom carbon fiber quadcopter optimized for speed and aerodynamic efficiency. Tuned the power system and PID controller for aggressive flight characteristics."
outcome: "Achieved flight speeds exceeding 100mph while carrying a high-quality action camera, enabling cinematic chase footage."

## Overview

The Pursuit Drone is a specialized tool for high-speed cinematography. Designed to keep up with race cars, drift events, and other fast-paced action, it bridges the gap between traditional film equipment and extreme sports.

## Performance Specs

- **Top Speed**: 100+ mph
- **Acceleration**: 0-60 mph in < 2 seconds
- **Payload**: Capable of carrying a GoPro Hero 10 or similar action camera.

## Use Cases

- **Motorsports Filming**: Chase cam footage for track days and drifting.
- **Dynamic Action Shots**: Following athletes or vehicles in complex environments.
